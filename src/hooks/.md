## Hooks: useArraySort

##### What problem are we solving?

Sometimes we have to sort data at the front and the default sort is either not enough or we have to write a lot of handler functions for [].sort().
This sort narrows the types of processed values to boolean | number | string and implements the shift order ASC > DESC > default > ASC > DESC > default and so on.
The order update is implemented by calling the [update] property without passing a parameter. But if we want to change the property by which we sort, specify [field] in the [update] parameters.
Through the property handler [handler: (item) => primitive] we can customize our property value in [].sort().
The [field] value supports JSONPath autocompletion.
You can work with primitive arrays without specifying [field]
Null | undefiend values will be moved to the end of the array in any sort order.
The order is determined by the [orders] property. Available 'ASC' | 'DESC' | 'default', you can specify any combination of values.
Performance lags slightly behind the default [].sort() method up to 1 million objects in the sorted array

```javascript
const sort = useArraySort({
        collection: todos,
        order: "ASC",
        orders: ["ASC", "DESC", "default"],
        field: "id"
});

sort.cleanup > reset to initial state
sort.collection > sorted collection
sort.field > current field
sort.order > current order
sort.orders > current orders
sort.update > update fn

```
